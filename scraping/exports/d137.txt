My son hangs out with an
autistic kid sometimes and I
don't want him to start taking
after him and becoming
autistic. How can I nip this
problem in the bud?

Isuggesl you have a slrong dISCLISSIOn wnh youv child's
other parent and suggest that they do the oarennng
from now on as you sound like a movon Autism Is not
contagious but, Iâ€˜m airaud SlUDldliy :5, so please stop
spreading yoms
