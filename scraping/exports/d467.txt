Oops, you've just killed someone! What is
the most creative way to hide the body?

I'd start some sort of tree planting organisation, based

of perhaps money=trees. I would then scatter the bodies
under these trees. Public focus would be on the trees and
no one would dig up a tree because of the public backlash,
over the years the trees would get bigger fully covering
the bodies hiding them forever and I would be a hero for
planting millions of trees
