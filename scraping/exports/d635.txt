My gf's explanation of why “ok
boomer” became a thing is spot on \/

Millennials tried for so long to
explain using facts and
evidence that they don't
actually have it that easy and
they aren't just lazy, but it
became very clear that
boomers don't care about
facts, evidence, or reality for
that matter. 80 this is what has
resulted. We've given up. | feel
like "ok boomer" is kind of the
equivalent of "Wow, you're so
horribly wrong, but I don't
have the time or the energy to
repeatedly explain something
to you that you're not going to
listen to anyway."
